# Advent of Code 2022 - Java

This repository contains Java solutions for the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

> :warning: You will find no code golf here. The code in this repository is intentionally overengineered because:
> - it's fun
> - I wanted to play around with specific patterns and language features

The challenges are runnable via the tests in each submodule.
